Ingredients

These is for 4 people.

100g Pancetta affumicata (smoked bacon)
50g Pecorino cheese
50g Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan cheese)
3 Large eggs
350g Spaghetti (use Italian brands!)
Olive oil, 2 spoon
Salt and freshly grated black pepper
Method

Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. Finely chop the pancetta as matches (2-4 mm diameter for 3-4 cm lenght), having first removed any rind. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside.
Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the olive oil. Leave these to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.
Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready lift it from the water with a pasta colander, then put it again in the hot pan. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen).
Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese and, using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. Finally adds baked pancetta and his oil, continuing mixing spaghetti.
Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.
